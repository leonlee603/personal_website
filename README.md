## Introduction

This is my personal website that created by Next.js. It is basically a place for myself to organize my notes about what I have learned, write something about my life, and record my personal growth.

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!
